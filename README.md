# Experiment Statement:
Implement weather modelling using the quadratic solution in stages: hard-coding variables keyboard input, read from a file, for a single set of input, multiple sets of inputs. Save all versions, debug, fix problems, create a GitHub account.
# Objective: 
Implement the quadratic solution in stages to model temperature variations, assuming it follows the curve 
T(x)=ax2+bx+c
where T(x) represents temperature, x is time, and a,b,c are coefficients derived from historical data.
# Stages:
(a) Hard-coding variables

(b) Keyboard input

(c) Reading inputs from a file for a single set and multiple sets
